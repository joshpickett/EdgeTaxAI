Accessibility Guidelines

Color Contrast

Ensure text and background color combinations maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

Typography Accessibility

Maintain sufficient font sizes for readability across devices.

Use bold and semi-bold styles sparingly to emphasize content without overwhelming the design.

Interactive Elements

Buttons and links should have a minimum tappable area of 48x48px.

Focus states should be clearly visible using the teal primary color or similar high-contrast highlights.

Screen Readers

Provide descriptive aria-labels and alt attributes for all interactive and visual elements.

Motion and Animation

Avoid overly complex animations to ensure accessibility for users with vestibular disorders.

Provide reduced-motion options where applicable.
